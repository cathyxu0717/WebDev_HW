2 pounds Yukon gold potatoes, peeled, quartered and cut into 1/2-inch pieces

6 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into pieces

1 cup buttermilk

6 tablespoons water

1/8 teaspoon baking soda

Salt and pepper

1. Add potatoes, 2 tablespoons butter, 3/4 cup buttermilk, water, baking soda, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to a Dutch oven and stir to combine. Bring to boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are nearly tender, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove lid and cook over medium heat until liquid has nearly evaporated, about 3 minutes.

2. Off heat, add remaining butter to pot and mash with potato masher until smooth. Using rubber spatula, fold in remaining buttermilk until absorbed and potatoes are creamy. Season with salt and pepper. Serve.
