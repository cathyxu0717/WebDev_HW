In the reading, the author Lissa Aguilar talks about the fiver important points about wireframing.
The five points are the following: clarifying the problem, workflows and sketches, get early feedbacks, know the tools, and know the audiences. 
She believes finding the problem is the prerequisite for creating a solution. 
If we can talk to the people who interact with customers in the front line, those information can help us to find the problem easier.
Then, declare a workflow with the team and remind people timeline to keep the flow going. Sketches should happen all through the process, and different people may need different fidelity sketch. 
Getting feedback early helps to spot out problems and build solutions. A great tool can help designer to save time, for Lissa, she likes to use Omnigraffle for wireframes.
